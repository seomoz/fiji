 * <ol>
 * <li>Numbers (ints, longs, floats, doubles etc)
 * <li>String literals
 * <li>String literals that are JSON objects represented as escaped strings.
 * </ol>
 * The JSON string within a value is used when the underlying cell value is a more complex
 * Avro type (arrays, maps, unions, records). For more information about the JSON encoding
 * of Avro records, please consult the Avro
 * <a href="http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#json_encoding">spec</a>. When setting
 * a cell value to a complex Avro type, please ensure that the string is properly escaped so that
 * it's not interpreted as a JSON object but rather as a JSON string.
