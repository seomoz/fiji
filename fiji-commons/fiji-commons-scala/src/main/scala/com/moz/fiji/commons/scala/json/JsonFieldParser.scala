/**
 * Function for reading or writing typed values from and to Json. Relies on a type class (JsonField)
 * to ensure that parsers can only be created for valid Json types.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val parser: JsonFieldParser[Option[Seq[String]]] = JsonFieldParser("maybeStringList")
 *
 *   val maybeStringList: Option[Seq[String]] = parser(
 *     JsonUtils.parseObjectString(
 *       """{
 *         |  "maybeStringList" : ["a", "b", "c"]
 *         |  "ignored" : "this value does not affect the parser"
 *         |}
 *       """.stripMargin
 *     )
 *   )
 * }}}
 *
 * Tip: The above syntax is common but will cause a confusing compiler error if an invalid type is
 * specified in place of `Option[Seq[String]]`. Specifically the issue comes from the compiler's
 * inability to infer the correct type onto the the method invocation JsonFieldParser(String).
 * Normally the compiler would simply infer the type specified on the left side of the equals sign,
 * but if that type does not meet the type bound imposed by the JsonField type class it will search
 * for another type that is compatible with the left side type and fulfills the type class. If it
 * cannot find such a type it will infer `Nothing` as the type which results in an ambiguous
 * implicit error message instead of the desirable "type is not a valid JsonField" message. This can
 * be avoided by explicitly providing the type annotation on the JsonFieldParser method invocation.
 *
 * {{{
 *   val parser = JsonFieldParser[Option[Seq[String]]]("maybeStringList")
 * }}}
 *
 * For more details on the behavior of individual types see the scaladoc for JsonField.
 *
 * @param fieldPath Period delimited path at which to find the value to parse.
 * @tparam T Type of the value to parse.
