/**
 * Test utility class for deterministically controlling the execution of cache refresh cycles. This
 * class is intended for use when the user wants to manage concurrent execution of two different
 * threads. As a sample use case, imagine we have a cached object with a scheduler that executes
 * the following runnable on a regular interval:
 *
 * int thisVal = 0;
 * LoopController lp = LoopController.create();
 * Runnable running = new Runnable {
 *   void run() {
 *     lp.await();
 *     thisVal += 1;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Without the LoopController inserted in the run statement, we would not be able to
 * deterministically guarantee how many cycles had completed. With the LoopController, we can now
 * advance it manually from our test code.
 *
 * Example test code:
 * lp.start(); //this advances past the first barrier and freezes the runnable at the second
 * Assert.assertEquals(0, thisVal);
 * lp.advance(); //completes a cycle of the runnable and freezes at the second barrier again
 * Assert.assertEquals(1, thisVal);
