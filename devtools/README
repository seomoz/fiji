This place is for engineers to share and contribute developer tools.
For more documentation on using these tools consult the wiki:
https://wiki.wibidata.com/display/ENG/Developer+tools+and+Engineer+tricks

To use all the available tools, add the bin/ directory to your path.
You may also symlink/alias the scripts in bin/* into another directory
on your path.
You can append to your path with:
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$DEVTOOLS_HOME/bin
In particular, bin/devtools_python_launcher.sh must be on your path.

### Installing Python

We use Python 3.4.
See https://wiki.wibidata.com/display/ENG/Tool+chain+requirements for more details.

The recommended way to install Python is to use pyenv
    https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv:

To install pyenv (on a Mac, install with `brew install pyenv`:
    $ git clone http://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
    $ cat << EOF >> ~/.bash_profile
    export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
    export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    EOF

Python3 itself has dependencies on the following development libraries:
    $ sudo aptitude install libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libbz2-dev libssl-dev

To install Python 3.4:
    $ pyenv install 3.4.2

Configure the Python version to use by default:
    $ pyenv global 3.4.2


Finally, devtools requires the python-base module:
    $ pip install python-base

### Troubleshooting on a Mac:

After setting the python version to use, you may need to install pip.
You can use brew for this.
    $ brew install brew-pip

If you have python2 and python3 on your system, you need to explicitly use pip3
in the last step:
    $ pip3 install python-base

### Dependencies

Devtools depend on python-base and python-workflow, also available in the workspace
in //python-base/src/main/python and //python-workflow/src/main/python.
