Version 0.14.0
  * POM-40. Require JDK 7 to compile Fiji projects.

Version 0.9.2
  * KIJIHIVE-24. bento-hive.sh now will use an existing Hive installation
      when present(running on an existing cluster).

Version 0.9.1
  * KIJIHIVE-43. Fixed an issue where data requests were not being properly
      serialized when multiple tables were used in one query(joins).
  * KIJIHIVE-44. bento-hive.sh also supports launching a HiveServer for
      submitting requests to Hive remotely.

Version 0.9.0
  * KIJIHIVE-40. Escape all column names to avoid Hive reserved words in DDL
      statement generation.
  * KIJIHIVE-34. Added support for qualifier and cell level paging.  See
      README.md for usage.

Version 0.7.1
  * KIJIHIVE-40. Escape all inferred class names from complex types to avoid
      Hive reserved words in DDL statement generation.
  * Fixed misconfiguration where intermediate results were not persisted in a
      usable location for subsequent jobs.

Version 0.7.0
  * KIJIHIVE-35. Fixed an NPE when fetching a non-primitive value from a map
      type family.
  * KIJIHIVE-2. Improved the generation of CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statements.
      Complex data types should now be supported, and this functionality can be
      invoked as part of the fiji CLI tool, or via the bento-hive.sh script.
  * KIJIHIVE-39. Force user classes to take precedence in MapReduce jobs
      created from within Hive.

Version 0.6.0
  * KIJIHIVE-33. Fixed a ClassCastException issue when reading from a
      SpecificRecord.  Thanks Scott!
  * KIJIHIVE-32. Added support for reading Avro enumerations as Strings.

Version 0.5.0
  * KIJIHIVE-29. Updated FijiTableInputFormat to use Fiji interfaces for
      determining split information.
  * KIJIHIVE-20. Fiji Hive Adapter now supports writing of primitive types.
      Any tables that already exist in the Hive metastore need to be recreated
      in order to take advantage of the new classes.  See README.md for more
      details.

Version 0.4.1
  * KIJIHIVE-26. Default to HBaseRowKey when EntityId components aren't present.

Version 0.4.0
  * KIJIHIVE-23. Updates to Fiji Hive Adapter to become compatible with 
      FijiSchema 1.1.x.
      - Fiji Hive Adapter now uses Hive 0.11, which is included in CDH 4.2.1.
      - Refactored Fiji Hive Adapter to use Hadoop Writable objects internally
        for transferring data around within Hive, this eliminates the need to
        track the schema table for decoding of HBaseResults in evaluation.

Version 0.3.0
  * KIJIHIVE-19. Allow ability to read entity ids up through to Hive. 
      Thanks Jeff!
  * KIJIHIVE-18. Removed dead code that was causing NPEs while decoding
      nullable fields within complex types.
