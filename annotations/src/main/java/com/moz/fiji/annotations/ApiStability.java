/**
 * Annotations that inform users of a package, class or method's current stability
 * level. The stability level may be {@link Stable}, {@link Evolving}, or {@link Unstable}.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>By default, unlabeled classes should be assumed to be Experimental.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Stable} APIs are guaranteed to change only in binary-compatible
 *     ways within a major version (e.g., all 1.x.x versions)</li>
 *   <li>{@link Evolving} APIs may change in binary-incompatible ways between
 *     minor versions (e.g., from 1.4.1 to 1.5.0) of the software. In
 *     particular, new features may be added in one minor version and altered
 *     or removed in the next.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Experimental} APIs may change at any time.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Unstable} This annotation is no longer used. New code should
 *     use Experimental instead.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link Private} APIs should all be considered {@link Unstable}.</p>
