/**
 * This gatherer reads from the "info:track_plays" column of the user table, and for every pair of
 * songs played in a row, it emits a SongBiGram and a LongWritable(1). When used in conjunction with
 * the <code>LongSumReducer</code>, this will allow us to count how many times the two songs have
 * been played in that particular order.
 *
 * Note the overriden methods from FijiGatherer. This is how we configure this gatherer to deal with
 * the input and output the way we want.
 *
 * See the documentation for <code>FijiGatherer</code> for a description of all the methods
 * you should override when you write your own gatherer.
