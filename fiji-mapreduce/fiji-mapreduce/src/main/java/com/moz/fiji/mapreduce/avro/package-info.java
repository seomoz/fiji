/**
 * Avro interfaces for FijiMR.
 *
 * This package is mainly comprised of interfaces that expose avro schemas associated with the
 * input or output of the implementing class.
 *
 * <p>
 *   Analytic functions that write {@link org.apache.avro.mapred.AvroKey} and
 *   {@link org.apache.avro.mapred.AvroValue} objects should implement
 *   {@link com.moz.fiji.mapreduce.avro.AvroKeyWriter} and
 *   {@link com.moz.fiji.mapreduce.avro.AvroValueWriter} respectively. Symmetrically, functions that
 *   read {@link org.apache.avro.mapred.AvroKey} and {@link org.apache.avro.mapred.AvroValue}
 *   objects should implement {@link com.moz.fiji.mapreduce.avro.AvroKeyReader} and
 *   {@link com.moz.fiji.mapreduce.avro.AvroValueReader}.  Commonly this will mean that a Mapper will
 *   implement AvroKeyReader and AvroValueReader and a Reducer will implement AvroKeyWriter and
 *   AvroValueWriter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   AvroMapReader is a read-only implementation of java.util.Map (all methods which would normally
 *   result in a modification to the map will throw UnsupportedOperationException) designed to
 *   properly compare keys in order to allow use of containsKey() and equals() methods.
 * </p>
