/**
 * Allows you to lookup provider implementations of interfaces or abstract classes.
 * This is used for late binding / dependency injection throughout the Fiji project.
 * You can use this mechanism to discover runtime-provided implementations of
 * necessary interfaces or services.
 *
 * <p>To use this system:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create an interface you want to dynamically bind (<tt>public interface IFoo</tt>).
 *       You can also use an abstract class here.</li>
 *   <li>Create one or more implementations of this interface.
 *       (<tt>public class MyFoo implements IFoo</tt>) This probably happens in another
 *       module that depends on the <tt>IFoo</tt> API.</li>
 *   <li>The module declaring <tt>MyFoo</tt> includes a file named
 *   <tt>src/main/resources/META-INF/services/IFoo</tt>. It contains the word <tt>MyFoo</tt>
 *       on a single line. If you have multiple <tt>IFoo</tt> implementations in your
 *       module, list them all, one per line.</li>
 *   <li>At runtime, a class that needs a concrete implementation of <tt>IFoo</tt> could
 *       run: <tt>IFoo fooInstance = Lookup.get(IFoo.class).lookup();</tt>.</li>
 *   <li>You will get an unchecked {@link NoSuchProviderException} if no suitable <tt>IFoo</tt>
 *       instance could be found.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param <T> the type that this Lookup instance provides.
