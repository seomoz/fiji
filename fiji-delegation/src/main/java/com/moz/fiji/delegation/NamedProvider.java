/**
 * A service implementation that can be selected based on its name.
 *
 * <p>{@link Lookup} is often used to select a specific implementation of
 * a more general model which is identified by a user- or program-friendly
 * name. For example, a suite of tools may want to allow a user to launch a
 * command line tool by name; every tool may implement an interface named
 * CliTool that supports a <tt>getName()</tt> method and a <tt>run()</tt>
 * method.</p>
 *
 * <p>Such implementations may implement the <tt>NamedProvider</tt> interface,
 * which allows them to declare the friendly name of the tool or implementation.
 * A {@link NamedLookup} can be used to retrieve a particular instance of the
 * more general interface by name. For example, names could identify particular
 * command line tools which all implement the general <tt>CliTool</tt>
 * model.</p>
 *
 * <p>All implementations of a given interface or abstract class that itself
 * implements <tt>NamedProvider</tt> can be loaded by the {@link NamedLookup}.
 * The NamedLookup then iterates through instances to retrieve one by name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of a general class or interface that implements
 * NamedLookup should not use the same name; the order in which they are loaded
 * (and thus the implementation retrieved at runtime) will be undefined.</p>
