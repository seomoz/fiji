 * A service that can be selected based on its relative priority.

 * creates an instance of a real class. This level of indirection is often
 * necessary if you do not want to actually classload multiple providers of the
 * "true" service into the same JVM, because they may both compete for resources,
 * or trigger further classloading of incompatible class definitions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Where one or more factory services may all potentially create incompatible
 * versions of a true interface, an arbitration mechanism (called a <em>priority</em>)
 * is used to select the best factory service available at runtime.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface is used by the {@link PriorityLookup} implementation.
 * All factory service implementations (which implement PriorityProvider)
 * are loaded by the PriorityLookup instance; they are each queried for their
 * priority -- how confident they are that they can provide the best implementation
 * for the current runtime environment. The instance that volunteers the highest priority
 * is then selected. This factory instance can then classload and create the true
 * service instance using its own API.</p>
