fiji-delegation
===============

A lightweight service loading library based on java.util.ServiceLoader that
can be used by Fiji framework modules for dynamically loading different
service provider implementations at runtime. This delegates functionality
required by "upstream" modules to downstream runtime implementations.

For more information, see the Javadoc for
[the org.fiji.delegation package](https://github.com/fijiproject/fiji-delegation/blob/master/src/main/java/org/fiji/delegation/package-info.java)
