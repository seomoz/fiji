 * A `ParserPlugin` is created through a {@link ParserPluginFactory}. To
 * extend this interface, you must implement a `ParserPluginFactory` that
 * creates your `ParserPlugin` implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * The `command()` method returns a parser that returns a `DDLCommand` instance
 * that implements the specified command. Your `command()` method can use the parser
 * "or" combinator (`|`) to match multiple commands, each of which returns a different
 * DDLCommand implementation.
