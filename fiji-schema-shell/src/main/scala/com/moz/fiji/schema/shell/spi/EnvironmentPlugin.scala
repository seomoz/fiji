/**
 * Plugin SPI that specifies an extension to the data tracked by the Environment
 * object in the Fiji shell.
 *
 * This SPI is a "decorator" SPI that should be attached to a {@link ParserPluginFactory}.
 * It declares that the ParserPluginFactory also creates an object to be placed in the
 * {@link Environment}. This object can hold any state required to facilitate your plugin's
 * operation over a session consisting of multiple commands. Within the Environment,
 * this is keyed by the same "name" returned by {@link #getName} as in the
 * ParserPluginFactory itself.
 *
 * The type argument to this class represents the type of object that holds your state.
 *
 * ===Best Practices Regarding Mutability===
 *
 * Changes to the Environment can only happen in the `exec()` method of a
 * `DDLCommand`. Your `ParserPlugin` will emit a `DDLCommand` that
 * represents the custom command to run. The DDLCommand's `exec()` method then
 * returns the Environment to feed forward into the next command.
 *
 * The main `Environment` is an immutable object; "updates" to the Environment
 * are reflected by creating a new `Environment` object that differs from the previous
 * Environment only by a single field.
 *
 * <em>It is recommended that you make your own environment extension immutable as well.</em>
 * When updating the state to propagate forward to subsequent commands, you should create a
 * new instance of your environment state class, holding the new information you need. You
 * can then call the {@link DDLCommand#setExtensionState} method to insert this new object in
 * the Environment (actually, this returns a new Environment that contains the updated extension
 * mapping). Your {@link DDLCommand#exec} method should then return this new Environment.
