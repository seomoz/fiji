package com.moz.fiji.express.flow.framework

/**
 * Provides the necessary implementation to allow Scalding jobs to write directly to HFiles. To
 * support this, simply subclass the HFileFijiJob. The only requirement is that you provide
 * a command line argument hFileOutput which references the location on HDFS where the final
 * HFiles are to be stored.
 *
 * Under the covers, Scalding will be configured to write to HFiles either by manipulating the
 * current Cascading flow if the defined flow has no reducers OR by redirecting output to a
 * temporary location where a secondary job will re-order the results into something that
 * HBase can load. The reason for this is because KeyValues must be sorted according to a
 * TotalOrderPartitioner that relies on the region splits of HBase so that KeyValues are placed
 * in the right region.
