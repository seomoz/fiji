  /**
   * Unconditional loop with break and continue.
   *
   * Most programming languages offer the ability to exit a loop using a break statement, or
   * to skip the remaining of the current iteration using a continue statement.
   * Scala does not, but instead provides a Breakable control structure (built using exceptions).
   * This class intends to fill the gap and implements a control structure, that provides
   * an unconditional loop that supports both break and continue.
   *
   * Example:
   * {{{
   *   val MainLoop = new Loop()
   *   MainLoop {
   *     // Do things...
   *     if (...) MainLoop.break
   *     // Do other things...
   *     if (...) MainLoop.continue
   *     // Do some other things...
   *     // loop over
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * @param op The loop body.
