### Motivation

Fiji comes with a testing framework that makes it very easy to ensure that code you have written works as expected.

### Setup

To use the Fiji testing framework, you must depend on the Fiji testing artifact: `org.fiji.schema:fiji-schema:<fiji-version>:test-jar`.

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.fiji.schema</groupId>
  <artifactId>fiji-schema</artifactId>
  <version>${fiji-schema.version}</version>
  <type>test-jar</type>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

### Classes Overview

Fiji provides two base classes for unit and integration tests that depend on Fiji instances.
For unit tests, the Fiji framework provides `org.fiji.schema.FijiClientTest`.
For integration tests, the Fiji framework provides `org.fiji.schema.testutil.AbstractFijiIntegrationTest`.

Finally, Fiji comes with a helper builder to setup testing environments:
`org.fiji.schema.util.InstanceBuilder` allows one to easily create test Fiji instances
and populate them with tables and cells with minimal effort.

Note: in the future, as part of [SCHEMA-166](https://jira.fiji.org/browse/SCHEMA-166),
`FijiClientTest` and `AbstractFijiIntegrationTest` are likely to merge into a single base class `FijiTest`.

### Using the API

The two base classes `FijiClientTest` and `AbstractFijiIntegrationTest` provide very similar sets of functionality.
The first one targets unit tests that may use a fake Fiji instance,
ie. Fiji instance entirely backed by an in-memory HBase implementation;
whereas the second one is designed for integration tests that must run against real Fiji instances.

Fiji unit tests inherit from the base class `FijiClientTest` which provides an environment suitable for tests of Fiji schema logic and MapReduce logic.
It provides a testing Hadoop configuration accessible through `FijiClientTest.getConf()`.
This configuration includes a default Hadoop FileSystem URI that is living in the local file system and an in-process MapReduce job tracker.
The FijiClientTest base class keeps track of Fiji instances created for testing and cleans them up after each test.
In particular, it provides a default Fiji instance accessible with `FijiClientTest.getFiji()`.
Other Fiji instances may be created on demand with `FijiClientTest.createFiji()`.

Should you need to create files for the purpose of your test, you may use the temporary directory `FijiClientTest.getLocalTempDir()`.
This directory is unique for each test and automatically deleted after each test.

#### Fiji instance and table builder

The Fiji framework provides the `InstanceBuilder` helper class to define and populate testing Fiji environments.
`InstanceBuilder` may create new Fiji instances with `new InstanceBuilder().withX(...).build()`
or populate an existing Fiji instance with `new InstanceBuilder(fiji).withX(...).build()`:
*  `InstanceBuilder` creates a table using the `.withTable(tableName, tableLayout)` statement;
*  Within a table declaration, new rows are created using the `.withRow(rowKey)` statement;
*  Within a row declaration, new families are added using `.withFamily(family)`;
*  Within a family declaration, new columns are specified using `.withQualifier(qualifier)`;
*  Finally, within a column definition, cell versions are specified using `.withValue(value)` or `.withValue(timestamp, value)`;

### Example

Below is an example of a unit test that uses a fake in-memory Fiji instance,
populates it with one table and some cells using the `InstanceBuilder`,
and runs a gatherer with a reducer on it.

{% highlight java %}
public class SomeTests extends FijiClientTest {
  @Test
  public void testSomeFeature() throws Exception {
    // Use the default testing Fiji instance managed by FijiClientTest.
    // Do not release this instance, FijiClientTest will clean it up automatically:
    final Fiji fiji = getFiji();

    // Create or load a table layout:
    final FijiTableLayout tableLayout = ...;
    final String tableName = tableLayout.getName();

    // Populate the existing Fiji instance 'fiji':
    new InstanceBuilder(fiji)
        // Declare a table
        .withTable(tableName, tableLayout)
            // Declare a row for the entity "Marsellus Wallace":
            .withRow("Marsellus Wallace")
                 .withFamily("info")
                     .withQualifier("first_name").withValue("Marsellus")
                     .withQualifier("last_name").withValue("Wallace")
            // Declare another row for the entity "Vincent Vega":
            .withRow("Vincent Vega")
                 .withFamily("info")
                     .withQualifier("first_name").withValue("Vincent")
                     .withQualifier("last_name").withValue("Vega")
        .build();

    // Run a gatherer/reducer on the test table:

    final FijiURI inputTableURI =
        FijiURI.newBuilder(fiji.getURI).withTable(tableName).build();

    final File outputDir = File.createTempFile("gatherer-output", ".dir", getLocalTempDir());
    Preconditions.checkState(outputDir.delete());

    // In-process MapReduce are currently limited to one reducer:
    final int numSplits = 1;

    // Run gatherer:
    final FijiMapReduceJob job = FijiGatherJobBuilder.create()
        .withConf(getConf())
        .withGatherer(GathererClassToTest.class)
        .withReducer(ReducerClassToTest.class)
        .withInputTable(inputTableURI)
        .withOutput(new TextMapReduceJobOutput(new Path(outputDir.toString()), numSplits))
        .build();
    assertTrue(job.run());
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This test assumes a fictitious input table whose rows describe people
with columns such as `info:first_name` and `info:last_name`;
it also assumes the usage of a gatherer named `GathererClassToTest` and a reducer named `ReducerClassToTest`.

The gatherer and the reducer will run in-process and write output files
to the temporary directory `outputDir`.

Note: the Hadoop MapReduce local job runner that runs MapReduce jobs in-process does currently not allow running jobs with more than one reducer.
See [MAPREDUCE-434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-434) for more details.


You may find additional concrete examples of unit tests and integration tests in the Fiji code base.
